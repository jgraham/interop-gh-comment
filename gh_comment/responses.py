We wanted to let you know that this proposal was not selected to be part of Interop this year.

On behalf of the entire Interop team, thank you for submitting this proposal for consideration.

We appreciate the work you put into your proposal, and would welcome your participation in future rounds of Interop.

For an overview of our process, see [proposal selection](https://github.com/web-platform-tests/interop/blob/main/2025/selection-process.md). Thank you again for contributing to Interop 2025.
